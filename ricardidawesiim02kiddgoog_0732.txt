For the nonsensical ανατολεισθω you write απολισ· mg,
θωνα. But we have by this means a Dnctyl in the --
beginning of a Trochsic verse, contrary to the laws

of that metre. By the way, the true writing of the

verb you have offered ¹* is απολισθανει. 1 read αν 330
απολισθοι “. This reading you wiu find preferable to
your conjecture, even in point of dictlon. 1 need

not mention its conformity to the lsws of Trocbsic
verse, or the proximity of its form to that of the
common lection.

plensure to, ir,
