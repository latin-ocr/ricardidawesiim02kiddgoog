In Sophocles likewise we find Ulysses himself assign-
ing Ajax the same place, v. 1357 (1340).

The Lot is cast and falls upon Ajax: This Homer
tells us was the very Event the Greeks wished for:

AjaciS. Virgil, 1 say, could not be unacquainted
with this order of the Grecian HeroeS‚ any more
than Horace, by whom Ajax is called, Hero-5, ab
Achille secundus. [Serm. 11. iii. 193.] And indeed
as to Achilles, in his fifth (fourth) Eclogue (36) when
he has no partial view, we find him writing in con-
formity to the established tradition: Atque iterun
ad Trojam magmas· mittetur Achilles. Nor can it
