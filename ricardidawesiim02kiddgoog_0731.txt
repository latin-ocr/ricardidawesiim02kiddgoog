nex. Greeks was sometimes pronounced El :and aa a proof
of this you appeal to EMI in the Delian inscription.
But this amounts to no proot', unless it be impofflble,
that EMI in that inscription should have any other
power than EIMI. Whereas 1 have assigned another
power indisputably possible, nay highly probable, or
rather certainly true.

Lastly, if the Delian Inscription be, as I maintain,
AEolic, ’tis plain, that your account of dialects and
archaism is not applicable to it. By your account,
‚ the distinction os dialects, as far as relates to the

- powers ημ and ειμι, did not take place, till the cha-

racter H was introduced. But, according to my
explication, we have in this inscription the power

329 ημι in the ¹* form εμι. So that your notion 'of archaism
and mine of dialects are not found to coincide.

1 am preparing for the press a volume in the
critical way, (which Ι shall desire the favour of you
to revise,) with the following inscription: Emenda-
tioner in Poetas G'raecos, Aristophanem, Euripidem
Sophoclem, AEschylum, Callimachum, Theocritum,
Pindarum, Hesiodum, Homerum. Proemittitm· dis-
aer-tatio de praecipm Poetarum dramaticorum metris,
uti et de Accentibue cum ψευδωνυμοις ⁹ tm ver-⁸25.
Hanc excipiunt animadversiones in cl. Bentleii
Emendationes in dua-s· iores Aristophanis Fabula-5.

prout in sermone Homerico obtinebat. Agnes· ex·-

- tremum claudunt alterae Animadversionem m Phile-
leutheri Lipsiensis sive Bentleii Emendationes in
Menandri et Philemonis Reliquias ¹⁰. Ihave a pretty
large apparatus, out of which these emendations will
be selected; upon Aristophanes in particular about
1500. For one of these Ι am in a great measure
obliged to a conjecture of yours, Lect. Lys. p. 686.
