Aru· the power ⁴* of the verb EMI was there not EIMI but
HMI. - You reply‚ “ lst. 1f1 maintain, that EMI is
326 archaice for EIMI, and you, that it is AEolice, our
assertions are not binding, the one upon the other3
but there must be some third judgment, some other
topic to be concluded by.” I answer, that supposing
neither of us could give a reason, whereby his hypo·
thesis might appear the more probable, our asser·
tions would amount to no more than if we had both
been silent. So that even upon that footing the
authority of this inscription would be set aside; and
that would be enough for my purpose. But further,
the digamma Ρ, which appears in the inscription, is
a strong argument for its being AEolic : for that the
digamma was peculiar to that dialect is at least highly
probable from the ep'ithet constantly given it. The
inscription has still further marks of AEolism: for if
it was not AEolic, there is no doubt to be made, but
that we should have there had ΤΟΡ ΑΓ-ΤΟΡ Aleos,
not ΤΟ ΑΡΤΟ ΛΙΘΟε for why should the power of
the aspiration Waw be left to be' thrice understood,
when ’tis plain, that a character expressive of it was
ready at hand ‘l The reason of our meeting with
such instances as ΔΙΟΝΥ ΣΟ is, that in other parts
327 of Greece there was no capital character ⁴⁸* denoting
the aspiration Waw. This, as well as the other as-
piration He, was lest to be supplied by the common
norma loquendi. On the contrary, supposing the
inscription to be AEolic, it will be liable to no such
objection; the power of the words will be w awa-o
λιθω ημι. The T, which I have prefixed to the O, is
absolutely necessary; for απτ-ος destitute of the ar-
ticle never means the same. Now my hand is in, Ι
shall add another conjecture about the genuine form
of this inscription, which 1 am perswaded has been
still further corrupted. The reading, which now
prevails, is no verse; and the language, when con-
sidered as prose, is vitious. The nature os prose
requires the article along with ανδρως, as well as with
