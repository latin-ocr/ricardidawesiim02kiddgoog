The second authority, which you produce, is that mx.
Of Athernei& ‚⁰ Παντες οἱ αρχαιοι τῳ ΟΥ nvn τον Ο ³-
E‘f‘x‘iiigsffixiss'ff’yo'iffflffssff ῑὶῗεὲἔιεῗέἰῖἇ ἷιῗέ
critics, as if the author had said, The Ancients used
ΟΥ aad O, EI and E promiscuously. The critics
must excuse me, if Ι cannot concur with them in
being so liberal to Athenaeus, as to bestow upon this

assage just twice as much meaning ¹* as it ever 322

d in it. He tells us only, that the Ancients used
ΟΥ instead of O, and EI instead os E: but as to the
converse he is extremely silent. This observation of
Athenaeus, 1 presume‚ relates to such words as νουσος
and Ξεινος, instead of νοσος and ξενος. If this he the
case, it either does not affect the present controversy,
or makes against your hypothesis. 1 could wish you
had referred me to the page, where it occurs in Ca-
saubon’s edition. But you have contrived a method
by transposing the author’s words to make him
affirm the converse of what has hitherto been his
constant doctrine. But the ancient system of gram-
mar, you say, requires this transposition. It indeed
allows of it, as far as O and OW are concerned; bnt
this, with submission, is all that it does.

. Your next quotation is from Plato ⁶.- Οἱ αρχαιο·

rav-ot ἰμεραν την ἡμεραν εκαλουν, οἶ δε impav- Yon
are welcome to add, if you phase, oi θε επ και εἷμεραν,
for even so the passage will have no relation to any
thing, which 1 maintain. It does not at all concern
my cause, in how many different manners soever
any word was at different times or at the same time
written. All that 1 contend for is, that the same
Greeks, who wrote E, never pronounced it EI, any
otherwise than as A was pronounced ΑΛΦΑ, ¹* that 323
is, when its name, not its power, was considered. 1
